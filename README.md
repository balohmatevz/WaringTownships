# WarringTownships

Warring Townships is a real-time strategy game in which you control your township and conquer your neighbours. 

Your colour is blue. You start with a town, which contains the central tower and multiple military buildings. 

The Barracks (identified with a training dummy) trains militia and infantry spearmen and swordsmen, the Archery Range (identified with a target) creates militia and infantry bowmen, the Stable (identified with a horseshoe) creates bow, sword and spear cavalry. 

To control units, left click them to select and right click to order them to move to a given tile. Click and drag with the middle mouse button to move the camera. Scroll to zoom.
